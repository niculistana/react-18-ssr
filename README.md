# React 18 SSR Demo
React 18 SSR Demo based on react-wg's **New Suspense SSR Architecture in React 18** [demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/festive-star-9hfqt?file=/src/App.js). For more information, [here](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/37) is a good deep-dive which explains how it works.

**NOTE**: The initial commits were generated by CodeSandbox after forking the original [demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/festive-star-9hfqt?file=/src/App.js). The intent of this repo is to make modifications to further test React hooks using a different example.
